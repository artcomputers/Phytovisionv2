# Phytovision

Phytovision is a Fruit and Vegetable image classification model powered by PyTorch developed in Jupyter Notebook

Phytovision was built on ResNet18 architecture pre-trained on ImageNet imported from PyTorch library.

The model was further trained on a fruit and vegetable dataset from Kagglehub, you can find the dataset at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kritikseth/fruit-and-vegetable-image-recognition/

The model was then deployed to a front-end website for anyone to access and classify images, you can find the front-end at: https://phytovisionv2.streamlit.app

Two of the most essential resources in the development of the project include PyTorch documentation and Streamlit documentation.

The PyTorch documentation was very useful in the production of the back-end, this can be found at: https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html
The Streamlit documentation was very useful in the production of the front-end, this can be found at: https://docs.streamlit.io/
